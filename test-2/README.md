## Technical Details

### Tech stacks

- Framework: NextJS
- Styling: TailwindCSS

I've chosen Next.js as primary framework due to its server-rendered approach and seamless client-side rendering capabilities. This not only enhances performance but also allows for efficient SEO optimization. Next.js also provides a structured setup that aids in modular development and easy integration of additional features.

Tailwind CSS will be our go-to styling solution. Its utility-first approach provides a consistent and flexible design system. With pre-designed components and responsive classes, we can achieve a polished UI while maintaining a smooth development workflow and can achieve responsive design in level utility.
